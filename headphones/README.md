# Responsive Hero Web Page

This project is a clean, responsive web page header built with HTML and CSS, following best practices for scalable and maintainable front-end design.

## ðŸ“± Mobile-First Design

The web page is responsive and adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes. Specifically:

- When screen width is **480px or less**, the layout switches to a **mobile-friendly version**.
- Content is **centered** and restricted to a maximum width of **1000px** for consistent appearance across larger screens.

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features

- **Responsive layout**: Works on mobile and desktop.
- **Reset CSS**: To ensure consistent styling across browsers.
- **CSS Variables**: For easy theming and customization.
- **Simple CSS Selectors**: Minimal specificity for easier debugging and overrides.
- **Hover/Active Effects**:
  - Links: `#FF6565`
  - Buttons: `opacity: 0.9` on hover/active
- **Structured HTML**: Semantic, clean, and maintainable layout using container `<div>` blocks.

## ðŸ§± Built with Solid Foundations

To ensure scalability and maintainability, the following principles were applied:

- âœ… CSS reset for cross-browser consistency
- âœ… Use of variables for easy global styling
- âœ… Use of generic class-based selectors
- âœ… Avoidance of deep or overly specific selectors
- âœ… HTML structure designed from **outside-in** and **top-down**

ðŸ’¡ Final Advice
"Building a web page the right way isn't easy â€” unless you start with strong foundations. Build from outside in, top to bottom. Structure smart, stay consistent."
